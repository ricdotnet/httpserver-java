This is just a means of learning and understanding more about http protocol and also java itself.<br>
When somewhat stable I will use on some of my APIs.

### TODO

- [x] Request and response objects
- [ ] Reflection (although it kinda works needs a lot of work still)
- [ ] Multi socket for requests
- [ ] Response headers
- [ ] Body serializer (json <-> java object)
- [ ] Better route system
- [ ] Route parameters
- [ ] Middlewares
